        <h1>Fastest Animal: Cheetah</h1>
        <h2 class="abc">Built for Speed</h2>
        <p>
            The cheetah is the world’s fastest land animal and Africa’s most endangered big cat. 
            Uniquely adapted for speed, the cheetah is capable of reaching speeds greater than 110 kilometers per hour in just over three seconds. 
            At top speed, their stride is seven meters long.
            The cheetah’s unique body structure:flexible spine, semi-retractable claws, long legs and tail allow it to achieve the unbelievable top speed of 110 km/hr (70 mph). 
            The cheetah’s body is narrow and lightweight with long slender limbs. Specialized muscles allow for a greater swing to the limbs increasing acceleration. 
            Cheetahs’ foot pads are hard and less rounded than the other cats. The pads function like tire treads providing them with increased traction in fast, sharp turns.

        <p>
            The flexibility of the cheetah’s spine is unique. The cheetah’s long muscular tail works like a rudder, stabilizing, and acting as a counterbalance to its body weight. 
            Swinging the tail back and forth continually adjusting to the movement of prey allows for sudden sharp turns during high speed chases. 
            The cheetah’s shoulder blade does not attach to the collar bone, thus allowing the shoulders to move freely. 
            The short blunt claws, which are considered semi-retractable, are closer to that of a dog than of other cats. 
            The claws work like the cleats of a track shoe to grip the ground for traction when running to help increase speed.
